# Continuity of valuation vectors

The integral-unit subgroup is open in the restricted-product topology. Consequently,
the valuation-vector map is continuous when its finitely supported target is discrete.
The topology of that target is supplied explicitly, without installing a topology on
all finitely supported functions.
