# Higher local fields and finiteness of roots of unity

A zero-dimensional higher local field is a finite field. At each successor
step we choose a complete discrete valuation whose actual residue field is
one dimension lower. No Galois-theoretic or finite-extension permanence
property is included in the definition.

Finiteness of all roots of unity is proved by induction on this actual
residue tower, using the reduction map in each of the characteristic cases.
